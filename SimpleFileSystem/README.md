SimpleFileSystem
================

This is the main code for the simple file system Arduino library.  You'll need to include this project in your main Arduino Libraries folder in order to use it as part of a project.  See the Arduino documentation on how to use a 3rd party library.

If you are concerned about the size of the library given it may have more chips supported than you need:  You can delete any drivers (or move them out of the way) from the project. Drivers are prefixed with "Driver" and can be safely removed prior to build.
